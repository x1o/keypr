Title: Credentials Management Using 'GPG' Encryption, 'YAML' Files and 'CLI'
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Dmitry Zotikov
Maintainer: Dmitry Zotikov <xio@ungrund.org>
Description: A 'CLI' and a set of corresponding functions to work with an 
    encrypted credentials storage.  A credential is a login-password pair, each 
    linked to a "service" identified by a unique name.  This information is 
    serialized to 'YAML' and stored encrypted with a symmetric cipher using 
    'GPG'.  'keypr' implements a convenient 'CLI' to work with the storage 
    (querying / adding new records).

Title: Credentials Management Using GPG Encryption, YAML Files and CLI
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dmitry Zotikov <xio@ungrund.org>
Maintainer: Dmitry Zotikov <xio@ungrund.org>
Description: This package provides a CLI and a set of corresponding functions
    to work with an encrypted credentials storage.  A credential is a 
    login-password pair, each linked to a "service" identified by a unique 
    name.  This information is serialized to YAML and stored encrypted with a
    symmetric cipher using GPG.  This package implements a convenient CLI to 
    interface with the storage (querying / adding new records).
